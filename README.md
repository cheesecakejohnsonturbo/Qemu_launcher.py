# Qemu_launcher.py
A simple launcher to setup and run, with limited options, virtual machines on windows QEMU. Should also work on linux, untested.
It will allow you to setup and configure multiple instances and select various iso, img files.
It's incomplete and lacks features but it should be enough to tinker with and get stuff working out the box.
I plan on adding more options later.
